# irrigation-sys

Code to control RPi-based irrigation and garden monitoring system.

Currently WIP, this project is unsupported and incomplete.

Information will be displayed over the network
through Flask.

#### Scope of Project:
 - Ability to water plants automatically, either based
 on schedule, temperature, humidity, or by soil moisture level.

 - Graphs detailing temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

 #### Versions
 `control.py` -> Full version, currently WIP. 
 `noGraphs.py` -> Same thing, without graphs, as the name would imply.
